					<p>I am an interdisciplinary artist based in Ramara, Ontario. My practice is indebted mainly to painting and conceptual art traditions and is centred in both religious and secular notions of emancipation. My work explores, among other things, partâ€“whole relations, protocols for producing disciplinary knowledge, and systematic approaches to abstraction. I am a graduate of the Master of Visual Studies program at the University of Toronto and have exhibited in Canada and the U.S. I am currently Curator at the Orillia Museum of Art &amp; History.</p>
