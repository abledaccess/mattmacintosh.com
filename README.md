# Matt Macintosh &mdash; More Art Than Art

## About

"I am an interdisciplinary artist based in Ramara, Ontario. My practice is indebted mainly to painting and conceptual art traditions and is centred in both religious and secular notions of emancipation. My work explores, among other things, partâ€“whole relations, protocols for producing disciplinary knowledge, and systematic approaches to abstraction. I am a graduate of the Master of Visual Studies program at the University of Toronto and have exhibited in Canada and the U.S. I am currently Curator at the Orillia Museum of Art & History. "

## Transformation

In it's life, my website has undergone a circular transformation. From static (via the twisted mind and hand of <a href="http://abledaccess.com/">abledaccess</a>), to dynamically driven (via WordPress), and back to static (with Jekyll's help). It's been quite the ride. One we're all better off for having taken.

Also this repository is now hosted/ generated on/ with Github Pages/ Github and Jekyll. <a href="http://mattmacintosh.com">Visit mattmacintosh.com to witness the result</a>.
