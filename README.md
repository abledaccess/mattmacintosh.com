## More Art Than Art

"I am an inter–media artist interested in the ways models of personal emancipation fold into knowledge. Rooted in painting and conceptual art traditions, my practice explores abstraction as a method to re–organize and even consecrate encounters between disciplinary knowledge and identity development."

## Transformation

In it's life, Matt's website has undergone a circular transformation. From static, to dynamic driven (via WordPress), and back to static (with Jekyll's help). It's been quite the ride. One we're all better off having taken.

Also this repository is now hosted/ generated on/ with Github Pages/ Github and Jekyll. Visit <a href="http://mattmacintosh.com">mattmacintosh.com</a> to see.
