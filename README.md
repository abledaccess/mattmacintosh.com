# Matt Macintosh &mdash; More Art Than Art

## About

"I am an inter–media artist interested in the ways models of personal emancipation fold into knowledge. Rooted in painting and conceptual art traditions, my practice explores abstraction as a method to re–organize and even consecrate encounters between disciplinary knowledge and identity development."

## Transformation

In it's life, my website has undergone a circular transformation. From static (via the twisted mind and hand of <a href="http://abledaccess.com/">abledaccess</a>), to dynamically driven (via WordPress), and back to static (with Jekyll's help). It's been quite the ride. One we're all better off for having taken.

Also this repository is now hosted/ generated on/ with Github Pages/ Github and Jekyll. <a href="http://mattmacintosh.com">Visit mattmacintosh.com to witness the result</a>.
